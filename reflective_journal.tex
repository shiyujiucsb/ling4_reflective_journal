\question{
What class activities and tasks were the most helpful to you, 
and in what ways did they contribute to the development of your skills?
}

{\bf Answer.} I think giving little lessons and simulating small lectures were the most beneficial for me. They gave me a great opportunity to practice speaking publicly, which is extremely important to me, since there are a lot of talks, lectures and academic meetings waiting for me in the future.

By practicing talking in front of the whiteboard, I came to understand that if I want to tell the story clearly, then I must firstly fully understand the story by myself. Also it is important to maintain eye contact during the talk. To attract the audience, it is also very important to give stress on speech rather than keep a monotone.
